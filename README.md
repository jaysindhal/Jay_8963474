### Heuristic Evaluation Table

| HEURISTIC | VIOLATION | RECOMMENDATION | SEVERITY |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| **1. Visibility of system status** | When users upload files or submit assignments, there is no clear feedback or indication that the action is in progress. This creates uncertainty. | Add visual indicators such as a progress bar or loading spinner during file uploads and submissions, followed by a confirmation message once the action is complete. | 3 |
| **2. Match between system and the real world** | The platform uses terms like "D2L" which may not be intuitive for new users. | Replace technical jargon with more familiar terms. For example, use "Learning Portal" instead of "D2L". | 2 |
| **3. User control and freedom** | Actions like dropping a course or deleting discussion posts are permanent and can't be undone, which can lead to accidental mistakes. | Provide an "undo" feature or a confirmation dialog before performing such irreversible actions. | 3 |
| **4. Consistency and standards** | The navigation menus and interface design are inconsistent across different sections of the platform, leading to confusion. | Ensure a consistent design and navigation structure across all parts of the platform. | 2 |
| **5. Error prevention** | There are no warnings before performing critical actions like submitting quizzes or finalizing grades, increasing the risk of errors. | Implement confirmation dialogs or warnings before executing critical actions to help prevent mistakes. | 3 |
| **6. Recognition rather than recall** | Users need to remember specific navigation paths and course codes, which can be cumbersome. | Add dropdown lists or auto-complete features to assist users in finding course codes and navigating the platform. | 3 |
| **7. Flexibility and efficiency of use** | The application lacks shortcuts and customizable features for frequent tasks, slowing down experienced users. | Introduce keyboard shortcuts and customizable features to make frequent tasks more efficient for experienced users. | 2 |
| **8. Aesthetic and minimalist design** | The dashboard is cluttered with too many elements, making it difficult to focus on important information. | Simplify the dashboard by grouping related items and using whitespace to reduce visual clutter, highlighting key elements. | 2 |
| **9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors** | Error messages are vague and do not provide detailed information or steps to resolve issues. | Improve error messages to be more specific and offer clear, actionable steps for users to diagnose and fix problems. | 3 |
| **10. Help and documentation** | The help and documentation resources are not easily accessible or comprehensive enough. | Develop a detailed, searchable help section with context-sensitive help options to assist users. | 3 |
